Site_Name=Harvard Forest
Station_Name=HARV_005
Site_Description=Harvard Forest (HARV) is a terrestrial NEON field site located approximately 65 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts in the county of Worcester. The 48.1 km2 (11,900 acre) site has sampling plots within Harvard Forest (managed by Harvard University and the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program) and the Quabbin Reservoir Watershed (managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation). Regionally, HARV represents a typical northeastern rural/wildland, anchoring an urban-to-rural gradient from suburban areas outside Boston to the wildlands throughout New England, Maine, and New Hampshire. The site's dominant land cover is northern hardwood and coniferous forest, with some areas used for agriculture. HARV is located in the Northeast Domain (D01), which encompasses the New England and northern Eastern Seaboard states along with the northern end of the Appalachian range. D01 includes one other terrestrial site and one aquatic site. HARV is located near the Lower Hop Brook (HOPB) aquatic site.
