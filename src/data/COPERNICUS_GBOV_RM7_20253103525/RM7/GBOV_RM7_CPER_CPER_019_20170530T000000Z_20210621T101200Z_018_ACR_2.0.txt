Site_Name=Central Plains Experimental Range
Station_Name=CPER_019
Site_Description=The Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) is located at the western edge of the Pawnee National Grasslands in Colorado, 19 kilometers northeast of Nunn, Colorado. The elevation ranges between 1,500-1,700 meters. CPER includes 6300 hectares of undulating rangeland. It is influenced by contemporary land-use practices, such as agriculture and cattle grazing. This site serves as a benchmark for exploring the causes and consequences of environmental change taking place throughout the grasslands of the Central Plains Domain, with results relevant to arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems worldwide.
